    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    let players2 = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // one way
    players2 = players.slice()

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    players2 = [].concat(players)
    players2[0] = "Karen"
    console.log(players, players2)


    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    players2 = [...players]
    players2[0] = "Karen"
    console.log(players, players2)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

      socials: {
        twitter: "@wesbos",

    // and think we make a copy:
    let person2 = person
    person2.age = 24;
    console.log(person, person2)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    person2 = Object.assign({}, person, {height: 2456})
    person2.age = 57;
    console.log(person, person2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // person2 = {...person}

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    person2 = Object.assign({}, person, {height: 2456})
